        <h2 class="sub-title">Resources for Educators & Students</h2>
        <p class="text bold">Our goal is to bring 10 minutes of substance use prevention to Vermont middle school and high school classrooms per week.</p>
        <p class="text">VT SUPER is a substance use prevention curriculum that is Vermont-specific and created collaboratively by members of the community. Spearheaded by local preventionists, the goal of this project is to make substance use prevention a part of the classroom in a way that is easy for both students and educators.</p>
        <p class="text bold">With 10 minutes of prevention per week, we believe that we will get closer to achieving our ultimate goal of having thriving Vermont communities that are free of substance use disorders.</p>
